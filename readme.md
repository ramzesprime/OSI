## Description

This is the first version of the OSI standard network model simulation.
The current stack contains only one **network layer**.
The current workspace has a console interface for user interaction.
Also, standard structures for future development (IP type, HOST type, MAC type, etc.) are implemented.
Simple network creation methods are applied.
